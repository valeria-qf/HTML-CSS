            <p>The question of the inclusion of women in Computing and technologies only makes sense if as “women” they are
                considered, really, ALL women, of the most diverse identity, ethnic-racial,
                age, class, sexuality, etc. However, the intersectionality of this discussion is not always
                happens, which draws attention, mainly, when analyzing the racial aspect, considering that the
                Black women represent 27% of the Brazilian population.</p>

                <p>In the workforce in Brazil, women and black people are only 1/3 of technology professionals
                and innovation, according to the #QuemCodaBr study. To talk more about why there are so few women and people
                women in Computing and Technologies and some implications of this disparity, I talked to Silvana Bahia
                which coordinates the PretaLab initiative.</p>

            <h2 style="clear:left">Why is it important to talk about black representation in computing and technologies?</h2>
            <p>Silvana Bahia: “First, because these spaces are completely dominated by men, for the most part.
                Are
                super masculine spaces, in general, and they are spaces of power. Everyone consumes technology, but,
                when we look at production, few people are producing the technology
                technology and men, these people have a standard, are: white, have, middle class or upper class, who
                always studied... So, the issue of representativeness is important, because it is the first step
                for us to say what may actually be necessary for these things, which is the issue of equity. Is very
                important about representation and how important it is for black women who speak
                spaces can look to the side and recognize. And it's not just about having black women there,
                it's about how we create an environment for these women to keep themselves supported.</p>

                <p>It is important to talk about representation in Computing and technologies, because this whole world
                technology has dictated a lot of our tastes, our choices and the policies that structure the
                world. If Computing is thought only “for” and “by” one type of person, this can create a lot of problems.
                Ideally, he considered having several perspectives on issues that are plural.”</p>

            <h2>What are the main challenges faced by black women in the IT sector?</h2>
            <p>Silvana: “I believe that the biggest challenge is the lack of access and opportunities. Per
                more than today people are very concerned about wanting to have the stamp of diversity, in general, the
                people do not understand that diversity is something that does not come ready-made and that it is necessary to make a
                investment, an effort, to be able to bring these diverse people and help in the formation of these people.

                Another challenge is the issue of representation, because when you don't see someone like you in a
                place, you don't think you can be there. If being a woman in technology is already a challenge, for
                black women ends up being even more challenging, because we have to deal not only with machismo,
                but also, with superimposed racism.”</p>

            <h2>How technologies can contribute to building a more just and equitable society for
                black women?</h2>

                <img class="tech" src="/img/69a3b354306a.png">

            <p>Silvana: “In order for technologies to be thought of as a tool for social transformation, it is
                important that we can think about technological production in a more diverse way, that is, more
                people thinking, producing and criticizing technologies. Although we don't know the full impact that
                this has in our life, we already know that it can reproduce many prejudices and exclude many
                people. It is a very complex field, but we always have to think that technology is not neutral and that it
                it carries the world view, the baggage, the trajectory of those who create. It's very different when a person
                peripheral, a black person, a trans person creates technology, because the views are different.</p>

                <p>I think that technologies can help in building a desire for a more just society, but I
                I think this only happens when we look at this bunch of apparatus that we have and think with
                a lot of willingness to go further, to create something that is more inclusive. I say this because we have a lot
                technology today and we see that inequality has not decreased. So what was missing?</p>

                <p>We live in a capitalist society, where profit and capital retention guide our lives and
                giant IT companies make money from it, for example by selling our data. So one way
                to contribute to the construction of a more just society is to bring more people to this construction
                and for this discussion. But that, it's not the technologies that will do it, it's the people who have to do it
                same." </p>
